# Xcode Shortcuts workflow

This is an *Alfred Worflow* which automates the following *Xcode* processes (I may add more later):

1)  Creating new playground files.
2)  Cleaning *Xcode* cache and *DerivedData* folders

Super simple to use:

1)  Type keyword "**xpg**" and hit *ENTER* to create a new playground. You can also supply a file name, eg.: "**xpg hello dolly**" to create playground: "**hello dolly.playground**".

2)  Type keyword "**xclean**" and hit *ENTER* to clean *Xcode*'s cache files and folders (inc. *DerivedData*)

Environment Variables:

1)  "**playgroundFolder**" : path to destination folder (defaults is: "**~/Desktop**")
2)  "**xcodeVersion**" : version to use when creating new playgrounds (default is: "**Xcode**")
